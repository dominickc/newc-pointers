# newc-pointers
 Using only pointers (no array indexing) write  a. a function to add all numbers i an integer array  b. a function to remove all odd numbers from an ordered array. The array should remain ordered. Would it be easier to write this function if the array were unordered.   I believe we can use create and use any array.
